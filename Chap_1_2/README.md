Three different types of machine learning:
# Supervised learning
* labeled data 
* Direct feedback 
* Predict Outcome/future 

## Classification for predicting class labels
 Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances or data points based on past observations.  
 Can be binary or multiclass

## Regression for predicting continuous outcomes -- regression analysis
 Predictors (features) --> response (target variables)
# Unsupervised learning
* No label
* No feedback
* Find hidden structure in data
## Clustering
## Dimension reduction
# Reinforcement learning
* Decision process
* Reward System
* Learn series of actions
## The goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment
 Via maximizing the positive reward and minimizing the negative one

# Terminology
* Training example
* Training: model fitting
* Feature, x
* Target, y
* Loss/Cost/Error function

# workflow
* Preprocessing
 - Rawdata collection/Missing data handling
 - Initial feature selection and extraction
 - Normalization/Standardization
 - Split and save a test dataset
* Training and selecting a predictive model
 - cross validation
 - hyperparameters
* Evaluating models and predicting unseen data instances
 - generalization error
